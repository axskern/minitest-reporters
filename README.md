# minitest-reporters - create customizable MiniTest output formats [![StillMaintained Status](http://stillmaintained.com/CapnKernul/minitest-reporters.png)](http://stillmaintained.com/CapnKernul/minitest-reporters) [![Build Status](http://travis-ci.org/CapnKernul/minitest-reporters.png)](http://travis-ci.org/CapnKernul/minitest-reporters) #

Death to haphazard monkey-patching! Extend MiniTest through simple hooks.

## Installation ##

    gem install minitest-reporters

## Usage ##

In your `test_helper.rb` file, add the following lines:

    require 'minitest/reporters'
    MiniTest::Unit.runner = MiniTest::SuiteRunner.new
    MiniTest::Unit.runner.reporters << MiniTest::Reporters::ProgressReporter.new

Now, just run your tests; the reporter you specified will be used and make your
output look absolutely gorgeous! If you feel the need to write your own
reporter, just `include MiniTest::Reporter` and override the methods you'd like.
Take a look at the provided reporters for examples.

The following reporters are provided:

    MiniTest::Reporters::DefaultReporter # => Identical to the standard MiniTest reporter
    MiniTest::Reporters::SpecReporter # => Turn-like output that reads like a spec
    MiniTest::Reporters::ProgressReporter # => Fuubar-like output with a progress bar
    MiniTest::Reporters::RubyMateReporter # => Simple reporter designed for RubyMate
    MiniTest::Reporters::RubyMineReporter # => Reporter designed for RubyMine IDE and TeamCity CI server; see below
    MiniTest::Reporters::GuardReporter # => Integrates with guard-minitest to provide on-screen notifications

I really like `ProgressReporter` for my everyday terminal usage, but I like
using `RubyMateReporter` when I'm executing test suites from TextMate. My usual
set up looks like this:

    require 'minitest/reporters'
    MiniTest::Unit.runner = MiniTest::SuiteRunner.new
    if ENV['TM_PID']
      MiniTest::Unit.runner.reporters << MiniTest::Reporters::RubyMateReporter.new
    else
      MiniTest::Unit.runner.reporters << MiniTest::Reporters::ProgressReporter.new
    end

If you prefer integration with RubyMine test runner or TeamCity CI server you'll need:

    if ENV["RM_INFO"] || ENV["TEAMCITY_VERSION"]
      MiniTest::Unit.runner.reporters << MiniTest::Reporters::RubyMineReporter.new
    else
      ...
    end

## TODO ##

* Make the boilerplate code look prettier. Something like a one-line require for the general use-case would be nice.
* Add some example images of the reporters.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests ##

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, but do not mess with the `Rakefile`. If you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump the version in a commit by itself in another branch so I can ignore it when I pull.
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for git flow feature branches.
